## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd DSA
   ```
2. **Explore the different sections** to find implementations and problems related to specific topics.
3. **Compile and run the C++ files** using your preferred compiler:
   ```bash
   g++ -o program_name file_name.cpp
   ./program_name
   ```

## 📚 Topics Covered

### Arrays
The `Arrays` directory contains implementations and problems related to array data structures:
- **1-D_Array**: Basic operations and algorithms for one-dimensional arrays
- **2-D_Array**: Operations and algorithms for two-dimensional arrays
- **Multi-Dimensional_Array**: Implementations for arrays with more than two dimensions

### Custom Patterns
The `Custom_Pattern` directory contains a collection of pattern printing programs (A-Z):
- Each file implements a unique pattern print algorithm
- Great for practicing loops and pattern recognition

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have new implementations, problems, or solutions, feel free to contribute.
